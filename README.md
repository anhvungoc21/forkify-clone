_Project built following tutorials in the Udemy Complete JavaScript Course 2022 by Jonas Schmedtmann._

## Description

I built this project while I was learning JavaScript in a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann. While parts of the project was provided by the course instructor (SCSS & some HTML), following and understanding how to build a project with multiple components and functionalities using the MVC architectural pattern was incredibly informative for a novice at JavaScript like me!
